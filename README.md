The AirBnB clone project is to deploy a simple copy of the AirBnB website on my server.
Each task of the AirBnB clone project is linked and will enable me to create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization.To put in place a parent class called(BaseModel)to take care of initialization of future instances.To create the first abstracted storage engine of the project called file storage. To lastly create all unittests to authenticate all classes and storage engine.


A command interpreter is similar to the Shell project with limited to specific uses such as a command interpreter can create new objects such as a new User or a new Place. It can also retrieve an object from a file or database.It can update attributes of an object and destroy an object.
